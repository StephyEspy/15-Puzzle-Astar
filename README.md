# A* Solver for the 15-Puzzle

This project is my own implementation of the **A*** search algorithm applied to the classic 15-puzzle (sliding tiles on a 4×4 board).  

The goal was to bridge **theory and practice**: implementing a well-known algorithm from AI coursework, but engineering it to the standard of a reusable software project. The codebase is modular, fully tested, and includes multiple admissible heuristics to compare performance trade-offs.

---

## Key Features
- **Accurate solvability check** for 4×4 puzzles (inversion + blank-row rule).
- **Multiple heuristics**: Misplaced Tiles, Manhattan Distance, and Linear Conflict.
- **Priority queue–based A*** with path reconstruction and search statistics.
- **Engineering polish**: pytest test suite, CLI entrypoint, modular source code.
- **Extensible**: easy to add new heuristics, board sizes, or visualizations.

---

## Why it matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate **AI theory** (heuristics, admissibility, consistency) into working code.
- Write **production-style Python** with tests, clear modules, and documentation.
- Think beyond correctness, focusing on usability and extensibility.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli.py --board "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 0 15" --heuristic linear_conflict
```

## Example Runs & Heuristic Comparison

### Easy Case (1 move from goal)
```bash
python cli.py --board "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 0 15" --heuristic manhattan
```

**Output:**
```
Moves: R (length 1)
Expanded: 2  Visited: 2
```

---

### Medium Case (10 moves from goal)
```bash
python cli.py --board "5 1 2 4 9 6 3 8 13 10 7 11 14 0 15 12" --heuristic linear_conflict
```

**Output:**
```
Moves: LUUURRDDRD (length 10)
Expanded: 11  Visited: 11
```

---

### Hard Scramble (25 random moves)
Generated by applying 25 random moves to the goal state.

| Heuristic        | Path Length | Expanded | Visited | Time (ms) |
|------------------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Misplaced Tiles  | 17          | 143      | 143     | 1.1       |
| Manhattan        | 17          | 31       | 31      | 0.3       |
| Linear Conflict  | 17          | 31       | 31      | 0.6       |

➡️ All heuristics find the **optimal path (17 moves)**, but stronger heuristics expand far fewer nodes.  
This demonstrates why **admissibility & heuristic design** matter for A* efficiency.

---

## Running Tests
```bash
pytest -q
```

---

## Possible Extensions
- Generalize solver to **N×N sliding puzzles** (not just 4×4).
- Add **GUI or web demo** to visualize the puzzle solving process.
- Implement more advanced heuristics (e.g., pattern databases).
- Benchmark on larger scrambles and profile performance.
